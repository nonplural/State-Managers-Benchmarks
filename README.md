# State-Managers-Benchmarks

This is a small repo that contains 2 ways of managing states using Roblox luau. The goal was to benchmark the both of them, mainly to see which one would be faster, and therefore better to use for performance-critical fighting games in Roblox, to be tested - it must be run in the Roblox engine, the state handlers must be modulescripts, and the benchmark scripts must be serverscripts.
